### My top projects

On my profile you will find some of my **personal projects** that I have developed in my free time, should they be public. I tend to keep many repositories private, as the code can be sensitive in nature!

These range from some where I am **trying to learn a new language/framework**, to a few where I showcase **what I can actually do**.

In summary, you can expect to find various projects related to:

ðŸ¥‡ **Discord Bot** Development ([JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA)/[Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/))

ðŸ¥ˆ **Full-Stack Web** Development ([React](https://github.com/facebook/react)/[Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node))

ðŸ¥‰ **Game Modding/Reverse Engineering** (Various)

### My favourite languages
